# WIP, probably for ever
A collection of plug-in-able bashrc modules

Add the following to ~/.bash_aliases file or to the end of ~/.bashrc to enable the aliases
  defined or referenced here, assuming that your .bash folder is added to ~ (a.k.a. $HOME or /home/\<linux-username\>)
```
if [ -f ~/.bash/.bash_aliases ]; then
    . ~/.bash/.bash_aliases
fi
```
